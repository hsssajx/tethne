AB Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), a relatively new group of
   epigenetic agents, are being investigated as powerful chemotherapeutics
   because of their antiproliferative and prodifferentiation effects both
   in vitro and in vivo, in various tumor cell lines. Only little is known
   with respect to their effects on normal cells. Yet, to understand tissue
   pathology and evaluate potential effects of new chemical entities in
   tissue homeostasis, insight into the physiology of healthy tissue is
   necessary. Therefore, this review addresses the effects of HDACi on
   healthy human primary skin cell cultures and three-dimensional epidermal
   models. In general, HDACi exert an effect on both the epidermal
   morphology and differentiation process of human skin. The latter is
   manifested through cell cycle arrest, disorganization of the basal
   layer, thinning of the stratum spinosum and thickening of the stratum
   corneum, reorganization of the cytoskeleton and increased formation of
   cornified envelopes. This overview shows that, although only a limited
   number of reports exist, these molecules might be an interesting tool
   for the development and study of new human skin models. Copyright (C)

AB With the advent of totally implantable hearing aids, the implementation
   and measurement of the microphone becomes an important issue. Engineers
   have to consider effects of the skin on the implantable microphone that
   did not exist in conventional hearing aid tests. In this paper, the
   transmission loss (TL) and absorption coefficient of rat and porcine
   skins were measured, and the synthesized skin was then implemented by
   using a gelatin gel that is widely used as an ultrasound phantom. From
   the measurement, the TL for rat and porcine skin was found to be 23.5
   +/- 2.7 dB and 30.4 +/- 2.8 dB (mean +/- std) at 1 kHz, respectively.
   Further, the absorption coefficients or the rat and porcine skin were
   measured as 0.029 +/- 0.011 and 0.031 +/- 0.012 at 1 kHz, respectively.
   From the measurements, the TL values were found to be significantly
   increased at the high frequency and the absorption coefficients did not
   changed significantly in the 1-6 kHz range. In additionally, the
   synthesized tissues also showed similar properties when compared with
   the animal experiments and they could be used to replace animal
   experiments for implantable microphones. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Dielectric properties of tomatoes crucially affect their heating
   behaviors in an electromagnetic field and are essential for developing
   microwave pasteurization and sterilization processes for different
   tomato products. The open-ended coaxial probe technique was used to
   determine the dielectric properties of tomatoes over a frequency range
   of 300-3000 MHz for temperatures between 22 and 120 degrees C. Three
   tomato tissues, the pericarp tissue (including the skin), the locular
   tissue (including the seeds) and the placental tissue were studied
   separately. The effects of NaCl (0.2 g/100 g) and CaCl2 (0.055 g/100 g)
   on the dielectric properties of tomatoes were also investigated. The
   dielectric loss factors were significantly different among the three
   tomato tissues. However, no significant differences were found in their
   corresponding dielectric constants. The loss factors of the three tomato
   tissues decreased with increasing frequency and increased with salts
   added. Increasing temperature increased the loss factors of the three
   tomato tissues at 915 MHz, but initially decreased then increased their
   corresponding values at 2450 MHz. The differences in the loss factors of
   the three tomato tissues were mainly caused by the difference in ionic
   conductivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   patients with high levels of masticatory muscle activity associated with

   polysomnographic evidence consistent with sleep bruxism participated in
   a 10-week single-group pre-test/post-test mechanistic clinical trial. A
   2-week period of baseline monitoring of individually biocalibrated
   electromyographic (EMG) events associated with sleep bruxism was
   followed by 6 weeks of EMG-event-contingent treatment via an innocuous
   electrical pulse to the skin overlying the temporalis muscle. Treatment
   was discontinued during 2-week follow-up monitoring. Each night before
   sleep, subjects recorded their average daily pain. Results: Mixed-model
   analysis of variance showed a reliable reduction of EMG events during
   contingent stimulation treatment periods, but frequency of EMG events
   returned to baseline levels during follow-up (linear term, P =.002;
   quadratic term, P=.001). In contrast, nightly pain reports failed to
   show any systematic changes during treatment (linear and quadratic
   trends, both P>.10). Conclusion: Spontaneous pain severity and nighttime
   oromotor activity vary independently over nights, even in M/TMD patients
   selected for relatively high levels of both characteristics.

   isolated cycloartenyl trans-ferulate (CAF), which is a major component
   of gamma-oryzanol, which is a byproduct formed during the production of
   Japanese rice wine "sake". CAF selectively inhibited the activity of
   mammalian A, B, and X pol families, but Y family pols were not affected.
   CAF did not influence the activities of plant or prokaryotic pols, nor
   the activity of other DNA metabolic enzymes tested. Individual chemical
   components of CAF, including cycloartenol (CA) and ferulic acid (FA),
   did not inhibit pol enzyme activities. CAF suppressed TPA
   (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-induced inflammation in the mouse
   ear, but CA and FA did not. The ability to inhibit mammalian pol enzymes
   in vitro was positively correlated with their propensity to suppress
   inflammation in vivo. These results suggest that this byproduct formed
   during the sake-brewing process is useful as an anti-inflammatory agent.

AB Flexible devices are emerging as important applications for future
   display, robotics, in vitro diagnostics, advanced therapies, and energy
   harvesting. In this review, we provide an overview of recent
   achievements in flexible mechanical and electrical sensing devices,
   focusing on the properties and functions of polymeric layers. In the
   order of historical development, sensing platforms are classified into
   four types: electronic skins for robotics and medical applications,
   wearable devices for in vitro diagnostics, implantable devices for human
   organs or tissues for surgical applications, and advanced sensing
   devices with additional features such as transparency, self-power, and
   self-healing. In all of these examples, a polymer layer is used as a
   versatile component including a flexible structural support and a
   functional material to generate, transmit, and process mechanical and
   electrical inputs in various ways. We briefly discuss some outlooks and
   future challenges toward the next steps for flexible devices. (c) 2013

AB The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling
   mechanism that controls many aspects of cell differentiation and the
   development of tissues and organs during embryogenesis. Early
   investigations have focused on the effects of Hh activity on the
   development of organs including skin, gut, the nervous system and bone.
   However, in addition to normal developmental processes, these
   investigations also found that Hh signaling is involved in aberrant
   proliferation and malignant transformation. Consequently, the role of Hh
   in cancer pathology, and its modulation by environmental factors is the
   subject of many investigations. Numerous environmental toxins, alcohol,
   and hepatitis viruses can cause hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is
   the most common form of liver cancer. Significant hyperactivation of Hh
   signaling has been observed in liver injury and cirrhosis which often
   leads to the development of HCC lesions. Moreover, Hh activity plays an
   important role in the progression of HCC. Here, we review findings
   relevant to our understanding of the role of Hh signaling in HCC
   pathogenesis.

AB Amphibian skin secretions contain a plethora of pharmacologically-active
   substances and represent established sources of bioactive peptides,
   including tachykinins. Tachykinins are one of the most widely-studied
   peptide families in animals and are found in neuroendocrine tissues from
   the lowest vertebrates to mammals. They are characterized by the
   presence of a highly-conserved C-terminal pentapeptide amide sequence
   motif (-FXGLM-amide) that also constitutes the bioactive core of the
   peptide. Amidation of the C-terminal methioninyl residue appears to be
   mandatory in the expression of biological activity. Here, we describe
   the isolation, characterization and molecular cloning of a novel
   tachykinin named ranachensinin, from the skin secretion of the Chinese
   brown frog, Rana chensinensis. This peptide, DDTSDRSN QFIGLM-amide,
   contains the classical C-terminal pentapeptide amide motif in its
   primary structure and an Ile (I) residue in the variable X position. A
   synthetic replicate of ranachensinin, synthesized by solid-phase Fmoc
   chemistry, was found to contract the smooth muscle of rat urinary
   bladder with an EC50 of 20.46 nM. However, in contrast, it was found to
   be of low potency in contraction of rat ileum smooth muscle with an EC50
   of 2.98 mu M. These data illustrate that amphibian skin secretions
   continue to provide novel bioactive peptides with selective effects on
   functional targets in mammalian tissues.

AB Collagen is the main structural protein in vertebrate biology,
   determining the mechanical behavior of connective tissues such as
   tendon, bone and skin. Although extensive efforts in the study of the
   origin of collagen exceptional mechanical properties, a deep knowledge
   of the relationship between molecular structure and mechanical
   properties remains elusive, hindered by the complex hierarchical
   structure of collagen-based tissues. Understanding the viscoelastic
   behavior of collagenous tissues requires knowledge of the properties at
   each structural level. Whole tissues have been studied extensively, but
   less is known about the mechanical behavior at the submicron, fibrillar
   and molecular level. Hence, we investigate the viscoelastic properties
   at the molecular level by using an atomistic modeling approach,
   performing in silica creep tests of a collagen-like peptide. The results
   are compared with creep and relaxation tests at the level of isolated
   collagen fibrils performed previously using a micro-electromechanical
   systems platform. Individual collagen molecules present a non-linear
   viscoelastic behavior, with a Young's modulus increasing from 6 to 16
   GPa (for strains up to 20%), a viscosity of 3.84 +/- 038 Pa s, and a
   relaxation time in the range of 0.24-0.64 ns. At the fibrils level,
   stress-strain-time data indicate that isolated fibrils exhibit
   viscoelastic behavior that could be fitted using the Maxwell-Weichert
   model. The fibrils showed an elastic modulus of 123 +/- 46 MPa. The
   time-dependent behavior was well fit using the two-time-constant
   Maxwell-Weichert model with a fast time response of 7 +/- 2 s and a slow
   time response of 102 +/- 5 s. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In childhood the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are the most
   frequent lysosomal diseases and the most frequent neurodegenerative
   diseases but, in adulthood, they represent a small fraction among the
   neurodegenerative diseases. Their morphology is marked by: (i) loss of
   neurons, foremost in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices resulting in
   cerebral and cerebellar atrophy; (ii) an almost ubiquitous accumulation
   of lipopigments in nerve cells, but also in extracerebral tissues. Loss
   of cortical neurons is selective, indiscriminate depletion in early
   childhood forms occurring only at an advanced stage, whereas loss of
   neurons in subcortical grey-matter regions has not been quantitatively
   documented. Among the fourteen different forms of NCL described to date,
   CLN1 and CLN10 are marked by granular lipopigments, CLN2 by curvilinear
   profiles (CVPs), CLN3 by fingerprint profiles (FPPs), and other forms by
   a combination of these features. Among extracerebral tissues,
   lymphocytes, skin, rectum, skeletal muscle and, occasionally,
   conjunctiva are possible guiding targets for diagnostic identification,
   the precise type of NCL then requiring molecular analysis within the
   clinical and morphological context. Autosomal-recessive adult NCL has
   been linked molecularly to different childhood forms, i.e. CLN1, CLN5,
   and CLN6, whilst autosomal-dominant adult NCL, now designated as CLN4,
   is caused by a newly identified separate gene, DNAJC5. This article is

   C-phycocyanin was successfully isolated from a commercial dry extract
   (AfaMax (R)) of blue-green Klamath algae. Protein extraction and purity
   were confirmed by gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE), MALDI top-down
   sequencing, Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry, and UV absorption.
   Purified C-phycocyanin was then encapsulated in different phospholipid
   vesicles: liposomes, ethosomes and Penetration Enhancer containing
   Vesicles (PEVs), the latter containing the penetration enhancer
   propylene glycol or Transcutol P. The main colloidal characteristics of
   the systems were assessed, showing spherical vesicles around 100 nm,
   negatively charged, with different lamellarity depending on the
   formulation composition. An in depth investigation on vesicle
   geometrical properties and morphology was carried out by Small and
   Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering. Further, the ability of rhodamine-labelled
   vesicles to allow fluorescent phycocyanin penetration and distribution
   through human skin was evaluated by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy,
   while a complete picture of vesicle-treated skin architecture was gained
   using Scanning Electron Microscopy. Results indicate that PEVs,
   especially propylene glycol containing vesicles, are promising carriers
   for the delivery of the high molecular weight protein phycocyanin to the
   deep skin layers.

AB Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins create structural frameworks in
   tissues such as bone, skin, tendon and cartilage etc. These connective
   tissues play important roles in the development and homeostasis of
   organs. Collagen is the most abundant ECM protein and represents one
   third of all proteins in humans. The biosynthesis of ECM proteins occurs
   in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). This review describes the
   current understanding of the biosynthesis and folding of procollagens,
   which are the precursor molecules of collagens, in the rER. Multiple
   folding enzymes and molecular chaperones are required for procollagen to
   establish specific posttranslational modifications, and facilitate
   folding and transport to the cell surface. Thus, this molecular ensemble
   in the rER contributes to ECM maturation and to the development and
   homeostasis of tissues. Mutations in this ensemble are likely candidates
   for connective tissue disorders. This article is part of a Special Issue

AB Wound healing is a complex process involving many interdependent and
   overlapping sequences of physiological actions. The application of
   exogenous lactate released from poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
   polymer accelerated angiogenesis and wound healing processes. Curcumin
   is a well-known topical wound healing agent for both normal and
   diabetic-impaired wounds. Hence, we hypothesized that the PLGA
   nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin could much potentially accelerate
   the wound healing. In a full thickness excisional wound healing mouse
   model, PLGA-curcumin nanoparticles showed a twofold higher wound healing
   activity compared to that of PLGA or curcumin. Histology and RT-PCR
   studies confirmed that PLGA-curcumin nanoparticles exhibited higher
   re-epithelialization, granulation tissue formation and anti-inflammatory
   potential. PLGA nanoparticles offered various benefits for the
   encapsulated curcumin like protection from light degradation, enhanced
   water solubility and showed a sustained release of curcumin over a
   period of 8 days. In conclusion, we demonstrated the additive effect of
   lactic acid from PLGA and encapsulated curcumin for the active healing
   of wounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Ingenol mebutate is the active ingredient in Picato (R) a new drug for
   the treatment of actinic keratosis. A number of derivatives related to
   ingenol mebutate were prepared by chemical synthesis from ingenol with
   the purpose of investigating the SAR and potency in assays relating to
   pro-inflammatory effects (induction of PMN oxidative burst and
   keratinocyte cytokine release), the potential of cell death induction,
   as well as the chemical stability. By modifications of the ingenol
   scaffold several prerequisites for activity were identified. The
   chemical stability of the compounds could be linked to an acyl migration
   mechanism. We were able to find analogues of ingenol mebutate with
   comparable in vitro properties. Some key features for potent and more
   stable ingenol derivatives have been identified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of local
   heating on the complexity of skin blood flow oscillations (BFO) under
   prolonged surface pressure in rats. Eleven Sprague-Dawley rats were
   studied: 7 rats underwent surface pressure with local heating (Delta t =
   10 degrees C) and 4 rats underwent pressure without heating. A pressure
   of 700 mmHg was applied to the right trochanter area of rats for 3 h.
   Skin blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. The loading
   period was divided into nonoverlapping 30 min epochs. For each epoch,
   multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA) was utilized to
   compute DFA coefficients and complexity of endothelial related
   metabolic, neurogenic, and myogenic frequencies of BFO. The results
   showed that under surface pressure, local heating led to a significant
   decrease in DFA coefficients of myogenic frequency during the initial
   epoch of loading period, a sustained decrease in complexity of myogenic
   frequency, and a significantly higher degree of complexity of metabolic
   frequency during the later phase of loading period. Surrogate tests
   showed that the reduction in complexity of myogenic frequency was
   associated with a loss of nonlinearity whereas increased complexity of
   metabolic frequency was associated with enhanced nonlinearity. Our
   results indicate that increased metabolic activity and decreased
   myogenic response due to local heating manifest themselves not only in
   magnitudes of metabolic and myogenic frequencies but also in their
   structural complexity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using
   complexity analysis of BFO to monitor the ischemic status of
   weight-bearing skin and risk of pressure ulcers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Oncogenic N-/KRAS mutations were frequently associated with MLL/AF10 in
   acute myeloid leukemia with myeloid sarcoma (MS). To study the
   cooperating leukemogenesis by MLL/AF10 and KRAS mutation, we
   retrovirally transduced MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C) into mouse bone
   marrow cells and generated two immortalized cell lines. The cells
   carrying cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C) had immature
   myelomonocytic phenotypes. Compared to a previously established cell
   line carrying MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) alone, cooperation of MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) with
   KRAS(G12C) blocked the cells at a more immature myelomonocytic stage
   with reduced expression of monocyte/macrophage markers. The mice
   transplanted with the cells carrying cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and
   KRAS(G12C), liked those transplanted with the cells carrying
   MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) alone, induced myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid
   leukemia, but in a shorter latency and formed multiple MS at the adipose
   tissues of skin, peritoneum and intraperitoneal cavity. Cooperation of
   MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) with KRAS(G12C) increased cell adhesion via upregulation
   of an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr125. Knockdown of Gpr125 in
   the cells by short hairpin RNA reduced cell aggregation and diminished
   MS formation in the transplanted mice. Our results indicated that
   upregulation of Gpr125 by cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C)
   promoted cell adhesion and contributed to the MS formation.
   What's new? The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of myeloid
   sarcoma (MS)a non-hepatosplenic extramedullary tumor mass made of
   myeloid leukemia cellsremain largely unknown. In this study, the authors
   established a mouse model that supports the clinical observation that
   cooperation between MLL rearrangement MLL/AF10 and oncogenic N/K-RAS
   induces myeloid sarcoma formation. They further demonstrated that
   up-regulation of the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor Gpr125
   contributes to leukemia cell adhesion and tumor mass formation. The
   involvement of Gpr125 in the MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRASG12C-induced
   myeloid sarcoma formation in adipose tissues has not been reported
   before.

AB The synthesis of tissue factor (TF) by monocytes/macrophages activated
   by inflammatory agents is of utmost importance in the pathogenesis of
   thrombotic diseases and substances inhibiting TF synthesis represent
   novel and promising antithrombotics. We investigated the effect of 12
   table grape varieties (white, red and black) on TF synthesis and the
   possible relation with the phenolic profile.
   The ability of grape skin extracts (GSEs) to inhibit TF was evaluated in
   whole blood and isolated mononuclear cells challenged with endotoxin. TF
   expression was assayed by functional and immunological assays. All GSEs
   inhibited TF synthesis but with a different efficiency, red grapes being
   the most active. By correlation analysis, the compounds showing the
   strongest association with TF-inhibiting activity were quercetin and
   cyanidin. However, no single polyphenol was able to inhibit TF synthesis
   as efficiently as the crude grape extracts, unless it was combined with
   at least another compound, suggesting a synergism. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   Phylogenetic analysis showed their grouping into five major clades (and
   10 sub-clades) that was consistent with their diverse functional types.
   Expression analysis in flower tissue revealed their distinct putative
   homeotic functional classes: A-class (PpMADS2-1, PpMADS3-1, PpMADS4-1,
   and PpMADS14-1), C-class (PpMADS15-1), E-class (PpMADS9-1, PpMADS12-1,

   gene expression was observed in different fruit tissues (skin, cortex
   and core) as well as in the cortex during the course of fruit
   development and ripening. Collectively, our results suggest their
   involvement in the diverse aspects of plant development including flower

AB Appropriate combinations of mechanical and biological stimuli are
   required to promote proper colonization of substrate materials in
   regenerative medicine. In this context, 3D scaffolds formed by
   compatible and biodegradable materials are under continuous development
   in an attempt to mimic the extracellular environment of mammalian cells.
   We have here explored how novel 3D porous scaffolds constructed by
   polylactic acid, polycaprolactone or chitosan can be decorated with
   bacterial inclusion bodies, submicron protein particles formed by
   releasable functional proteins. A simple dipping-based decoration method
   tested here specifically favors the penetration of the functional
   particles deeper than 300 mu m from the materials' surface. The
   functionalized surfaces support the intracellular delivery of
   biologically active proteins to up to more than 80% of the colonizing
   cells, a process that is slightly influenced by the chemical nature of
   the scaffold. The combination of 3D soft scaffolds and protein-based
   sustained release systems (Bioscaffolds) offers promise in the
   fabrication of bio-inspired hybrid matrices for multifactorial control
   of cell proliferation in tissue engineering under complex architectonic
   setting-ups. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   10, 2.5, and 1m (PM10, PM2.5, and PM1) and number concentrations of
   submicron particles were measured. The authors observed elevated levels
   of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1, and accumulation-mode particles were associated
   with decreased PEFR in children with AD. The PEFR decrements were -2.89
   L/min (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.93 to -0.89) for an
   interquartile-range increase of previous-day PM10, -2.79 L/min (95% CI,
   -4.89 to -0.69) for PM2.5, and -2.71 L/min (95% CI, -4.81 to -0.61) for
   PM1. These results suggest that ambient fine particles may affect the
   pulmonary function in children with AD. The respiratory health of
   children with atopic skin disorders renders them more vulnerable to
   ambient particles than healthy subjects.

   found a similar prevalence of ERRS and EIB in both bakers and controls.
   EIB was significantly associated with atopy, asthma, family history of
   asthma, and positive histamine challenge in either group, whereas in
   bakers it was closely related to sensitization to occupational allergens
   (p = .032). Bronchial reaction to exercise was significantly higher in

AB Vitiligo is an acquired immune disorder of the skin characterized by the
   presence of white depigmented macules. Its immunopathogenesis is not
   completely understood, but inflammatory alterations in the skin
   microenvironment, and particularly increased expression of the cytokine
   tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), are thought to be essential
   regulators of melanocyte dysfunction and death. In this article we
   review the evidence that implicates TNF alpha in the pathogenesis of
   vitiligo, including studies on serum and tissue levels of TNF alpha, TNF
   alpha gene polymorphisms, in vitro studies, and therapeutic trials using
   TNF alpha inhibitors. TNF alpha emerges as a complex mediator with
   apparently conflicting roles in vitiligo.

AB Deleobuvir (BI 207127) is an investigational oral nonnucleoside
   inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA polymerase. Antiviral
   activity, virology, pharmacokinetics, and safety were assessed in HCV
   genotype 1-infected patients receiving 5 days' deleobuvir mono-therapy.
   In this double-blind phase 1b study, treatment-naive (TN; n = 15) and
   treatment-experienced (TE; n = 45) patients without cirrhosis received
   placebo or deleobuvir at 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1,200 mg every 8 h (q8h)
   for 5 days. Patients with cirrhosis (n = 13) received deleobuvir at 400
   or 600 mg q8h for 5 days. Virologic analyses included NS5B genotyping
   and phenotyping of individual isolates. At day 5, patients without
   cirrhosis had dose-dependent median HCV RNA reductions of up to 3.8
   log(10) (with no placebo response); patients with cirrhosis had median
   HCV RNA reductions of approximately 3.0 log(10). Three patients
   discontinued due to adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs were
   gastrointestinal, nervous system, and skin/cutaneous tissue disorders.
   Plasma exposure of deleobuvir was supraproportional at doses >= 400 mg
   q8h and approximately 2-fold higher in patients with cirrhosis than in
   patients without cirrhosis. No virologic breakthrough was observed. NS5B
   substitutions associated with deleobuvir resistance in vitro were
   detected in 9/59 patients; seven encoded P495 substitutions, including
   P495L, which conferred 120- to 310-fold-decreased sensitivity to
   deleobuvir. P495 variants did not persist in follow-up without selective
   drug pressure. Deleobuvir monotherapy was generally well tolerated and
   demonstrated dose-dependent antiviral activity against HCV genotype 1
   over 5 days.

AB Yes Associated Protein (YAP) has been implicated in the control of organ
   size by regulating cell proliferation and survival. YAP is a
   transcriptional coactivator that controls cellular responses through
   interaction with TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus, while its
   transcriptional functions are inhibited by phosphorylation-dependent
   translocation to the cytosol. YAP overexpression has been associated
   with different types of cancer, such as lung, skin, prostate, ovary and
   liver cancer. Recently, YAP was linked to E-cadherin-dependent
   regulation of contact inhibition in breast cancer cells.
   In this study we examined YAP protein expression and cellular
   localization in 237 cases of human invasive breast cancer by
   immunohistochemistry and related its expression to clinicopathological
   features and E-cadherin expression. We observed that invasive lobular
   carcinoma is characterized by higher expression levels of both nuclear
   and cytosolic YAP (p < 0.001). Nuclear YAP expression did not associate
   with other variables such as lymph node involvement, tumor grade, tumor
   size, mitotic activity or the molecular sub-types of invasive breast
   cancer. We observed that high nuclear and cytosolic YAP expression are
   associated with the E-cadherin deficient breast cancer subtype ILC (p <
   0.001) and cell lines derived from human breast cancers and conditional
   mouse models of human lobular breast cancer.
   Since our data indicate that nuclear YAP localization is more common in
   breast cancers lacking functional adherens junctions, it suggests that
   YAP-mediated transcription may be involved in the development and
   progression of invasive lobular breast cancer.

AB Two types of cellulose-based materials, 6-carboxycellulose with 2.1 or
   6.6 wt% of -COOH groups, were prepared and tested for potential use in
   tissue engineering. The materials were functionalized with arginine,
   i.e. an amino acid with a basic side chain, or with chitosan, in order
   to balance the relatively acid character of oxidized cellulose
   molecules, and were seeded with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The
   cell adhesion and growth were then evaluated directly on the materials,
   and also on the underlying polystyrene culture dishes. Of these two
   types of studied materials, 6-carboxycellulose with 2.1 wt% of -COOH
   groups was more appropriate for cell colonization. The cells on this
   material achieved an elongated shape, while they were spherical in shape
   on the other materials. The number of cells and the concentration (per
   mg of protein) of contractile proteins alpha-actin and SM1 and SM2
   myosins, i.e. markers of the phenotypic maturation of VSMC, were also
   significantly higher on this material. Functionalization of the material
   with arginine and chitosan further improved the phenotypic maturation of
   VSMC. Chitosan also improved the adhesion and growth of these cells. In
   comparison with the control polystyrene dishes, the proliferation of
   cells on our cellulose-based materials was relatively low. This suggests
   that these materials can be used in applications where high
   proliferation activity of cells is not desirable, e.g. proliferation of
   VSMC on vascular prostheses. Alternatively, the cell proliferation might
   be enhanced by another more efficient modification, which would require
   further research.

AB In the 40 years since Elsdale and Bard's analysis of fibroblast culture
   in collagen gels we have moved far beyond the concept that such 3D
   fibril network systems are better models than monolayer cultures. This
   review analyses key aspects of that progression of models, against a
   background of what exactly each model system tries to mimic. This story
   tracks our increasing understanding of fibroblast responses to soft
   collagen gels, in particularly their cytoskeletal contraction, migration
   and integrin attachment. The focus on fibroblast mechano-function has
   generated models designed to directly measure the overall force
   generated by fibroblast populations, their reaction to external loads
   and the role of the matrix structure. Key steps along this evolution of
   3D collagen models have been designed to mimic normal skin, wound
   repair, tissue morphogenesis and remodelling, growth and contracture
   during scarring/fibrosis. As new models are developed to understand
   cell-mechanical function in connective tissues the collagen material has
   become progressively more important, now being engineered to mimic more
   complex aspects of native extracellular matrix structure. These have
   included collagen fibril density, alignment and hierarchical structure,
   controlling material stiffness and anisotropy. But of these, tissue-like
   collagen density is key in that it contributes to control of the others.
   It is concluded that across this 40 year window major progress has been
   made towards establishing a family of 3D experimental collagen
   tissue-models, suitable to investigate normal and pathological
   fibroblast mechano-functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB There is currently no 'gold standard' for diagnosis of latent

   latter have a higher sensitivity than tuberculin skin tests for
   diagnosis of LTBI in HIV-infected individuals with lower CD4 counts. No
   evidence base exists for selection of IGRA methodology to identify LTBI
   among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in the UK. We
   prospectively evaluated two commercially available IGRA methods
   (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube [QFG] and T-SPOT. TB) for testing LTBI
   among HIV-infected patients potentially nosocomially exposed to an
   HIV-infected patient with 'smear-positive' pulmonary tuberculosis. Among
   the exposed patients median CD4 count was 550 cells/mu L; 105 (90%) of
   117 were receiving antiretroviral therapy, of who 104 (99%) had an
   undetectable plasma HIV load. IGRAs were positive in 12 patients
   (10.3%); QFG positive in 11 (9.4%) and T-SPOT. TB positive in six
   (5.1%); both IGRAs were positive in five patients (4.3%). There was one
   indeterminate QFG and one borderline T-SPOT. TB result. Concordance
   between the two IGRAs was moderate (k = 0.56, 95% confidence interval
   0.27-0.85). IGRAs were positive in only 4 (29%) of 14 patients with

AB Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic used for the treatment of
   pneumonia and uncomplicated and complicated skin and soft tissues
   infections caused by Gram positive bacteria. It is also used as second
   line agent in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. Therapeutic drug
   monitoring (TOM) of linezolid represents a valid tool in clinical
   practice to optimize therapy, especially in critically ill patients.
   Spreading of TDM is mainly limited by high costs shipment and lack of
   laboratories that offer a TDM service. To overcome these problems, the
   use of dried plasma spots or dried blood spots is increasing. The aim of
   this work was to develop and validate a new chromatographic method to
   analyze linezolid in plasma and in dried plasma spots and to evaluate
   the correlation between the two extraction methods. Linezolid extraction
   from plasma and from dried plasma spots was obtained using acetonitrile.
   Quinoxaline was used as internal standard. Analysis was performed by an
   ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system coupled with photo
   diode array (PDA) detector, at 254 nm. Both analytical methods were
   linear (r(2)>0.999) over the calibration range of 30-0.117 mg/L. Limit
   of quantification and limit of detection were 0.117 mg/L and 0.058 mg/L,
   respectively. Intra and inter-day precision (R.S.D.%) and accuracy (%)
   were <15%. Long term stability of linezolid in dried plasma spots showed
   absence of degradation at room temperature (20-25 degrees C) and at 4
   degrees C, for at least one month. Linear regression analysis confirmed
   that the two methods of extraction have good correlation. Thus they are
   suited for TDM of linezolid and for pharmacokinetic studies. (C) 2013

AB Chronic inflammation and excessive protease activity have a major role
   in the persistence of non-healing wounds. Granzyme B (GzmB) is a serine
   protease expressed during chronic inflammation that, in conjunction with
   perforin, has a well-established role in initiating apoptotic cell
   death. GzmB is also capable of acting extracellularly, independent of
   perforin and can degrade several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins
   that are critical during wound healing. We used apolipoprotein E (ApoE)
   knockout (AKO) mice as a novel model of chronic inflammation and
   impaired wound healing to investigate the role of GzmB in chronic
   wounds. Wild-type and AKO mice were grown to 7 weeks (young) or 37 weeks
   (old) of age on a regular chow or high-fat diet (HFD), given a 1-cm
   diameter full thickness wound on their mid dorsum and allowed to heal
   for 16 days. Old AKO mice fed a HFD exhibited reduced wound closure,
   delayed contraction, chronic inflammation and altered ECM remodeling.
   Conversely, GzmB/ApoE double knockout mice displayed improved wound
   closure and contraction rates. In addition, murine GzmB was found to
   degrade both fibronectin and vitronectin derived from healthy mouse
   granulation tissue. In addition, GzmB-mediated degradation of
   fibronectin generated a fragment similar in size to that observed in
   non-healing mouse wounds. These results provide the first direct
   evidence that GzmB contributes to chronic wound healing in part through
   degradation of ECM.

AB Hydroquinone and tranexamic acids (TXA) are skin-lightening agents with
   a hydrophilic nature and low skin absorption. A high dose is needed for
   clinical use, resulting in a high incidence of skin irritation. Co-drugs
   formed by conjugating hydroquinone and TXA were synthesized and their in
   vitro and in vivo skin absorption characteristics were evaluated. The
   two synthesized co-drugs were 4-hydroxyphenyl
   4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylate (HAC) and 1,4-phenylene
   bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylate (BAC). The co-drugs were
   chemically stable in aqueous solution, but rapidly degraded to the
   respective parent drug in esterases and skin homogenates. Compared to
   hydroquinone application, 7.2- and 2.4-fold increments in the
   hydroquinone skin deposition were obtained with the in vitro application
   of HAC and BAC. HAC and BAC led to 3- and 2-fold enhancements of
   equivalent TXA deposition compared to TXA administration. The in vivo
   experiment showed a further enhancement of co-drugs compared to the in
   vitro setup. The transdermal penetration of co-drugs, especially BAC,
   was much lower than that of hydroquinone and TXA. This indicated
   high-level skin targeting by the co-drugs. HAC and BAC revealed strong
   affinities for the viable epidermis/dermis. Hair follicles are important
   reservoirs for co-drug delivery. Daily administration of co-drugs to the
   skin did not generate irritation for up to 7 days. Both co-drugs are
   superior candidates for treating skin hyperpigmentation.

AB Background Daptomycin has proven efficacy in patients with Gram-positive
   complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs), including those
   caused by Staphylococcus aureus, regardless of methicillin
   susceptibility.
   Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety
   of daptomycin in elderly patients.
   Study design This was an open-label, multicentre, randomized phase IIIb
   study conducted in hospitalized patients Patients aged >= 65 years with
   a diagnosis of Gram-positive cSSTIs with or without bacteraemia were
   included. In addition, infections were required to be of sufficient
   severity to require inpatient hospitalization and treatment with
   parenteral antibiotics for at least 96 h. The main exclusion criterion
   was the presence of a non-complicated SSTI that could heal by itself or
   be cured by surgical removal of the site of infection.
   Intervention Patients were randomized (2:1) to intravenous daptomycin or
   pooled intravenous standard therapies (semi-synthetic penicillin or
   vancomycin, referred to as the 'comparator'). Duration of treatment was
   between 5 and 14 days for cSSTIs without bacteraemia and between 10 and
   28 days for cSSTIs with bacteraemia.
   Main Outcome Measure The primary objective was descriptive comparison of
   clinical success in clinically evaluable patients at test of cure, 7-14
   days post treatment. Secondary objectives were microbiological outcome,
   duration of treatment and safety.
   Results In total, 120 patients were randomized (81 to daptomycin; 39 to
   the comparator) and 102 patients completed the study. Baseline
   characteristics were similar between the two groups. Common infections
   included cellulitis, ulcers and abscesses; six patients had bacteraemia
   [five documented (daptomycin, n = 3; comparator, n = 2); and one
   suspected (daptomycin, n = 1)]. Test-of-cure clinical success rates were
   numerically higher for daptomycin than for the comparator [89.0 %
   (65/73) vs. 83.3 % (25/30); odds ratio 1.65 (95 % confidence interval
   0.49-5.54)]. For patients with S. aureus infections, cure rates were
   89.7 % (35/39) versus 69.2 % (9/13), respectively; percentage points
   difference, 20.5 (95 % confidence interval -12.2 to 50.9)]. Rates of
   adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar in both treatment
   arms; however, discontinuation rates for AEs/serious AEs were lower for
   daptomycin than for the comparator (3.8 % vs. 10.0 %). Three serious AEs
   were considered to be related to the study drug: one case each of
   pancytopenia (semi-synthetic penicillin), renal failure (vancomycin) and
   asymptomatic increase in creatine phosphokinase concentrations
   (daptomycin).
   Conclusion In elderly patients, for whom data were previously limited,
   the efficacy and safety of daptomycin have been confirmed, including for
   infections caused by S. aureus, regardless of methicillin
   susceptibility.

AB Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) may occur in children with cancer
   during the use of almost all chemotherapeutic drugs. HSRs may also
   produce a negative impact on treatment intensity and, as a consequence,
   worsen patients' outcome. The aim of this review is to summarize the
   incidence and the clinical features of HSRs occurring in children with
   cancer treated with chemotherapeutic drugs and their impact on treatment
   efficacy, in order to outline possible adequate prevention and
   management strategies.
   Data were collected by searching for relevant studies about incidence,
   clinical features and management of hypersensitivity reactions that may
   occur with the use of chemotherapeutic agents in children aged 0-18
   years, published from January 1976 to December 2012 in the PubMed
   database.
   In children with cancer treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (especially
   platinum compounds, methotrexate, L-asparaginase), HSRs commonly present
   with mild/moderate to severe clinical patterns. Multiple factors appear
   to affect reaction rates, including route, rate of administration,
   previous exposure, drug form, presence of excipients. The occurrence of
   hypersensitivity to a chemotherapeutic agent can include the avoidance
   of re-exposure. For sensitized patients who have derived clinically
   meaningful benefit from a particular agent, however, continuation of
   treatment with the agent is desirable. Options may include attempting a
   trial of desensitization or treatment with a related compound.
   With the increasing use of cancer chemotherapy agents, hypersensitivity
   reactions to antineoplastic drugs are commonly encountered. Clinicians
   must not underestimate the potential risk and occurrence of HSRs in the
   pediatric population. Knowledge of the different presentations of these
   reactions can help to develop strategies for the prevention and the
   management of HSRs in order to ensure treatment outcome, to improve the
   quality of patient care and to reduce healthcare costs.
