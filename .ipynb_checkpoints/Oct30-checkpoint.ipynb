        "{'': '', 'AB': 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), a relatively new group of epigenetic agents, are being investigated as powerful chemotherapeutics because of their antiproliferative and prodifferentiation effects both in vitro and in vivo, in various tumor cell lines. Only little is known with respect to their effects on normal cells. Yet, to understand tissue pathology and evaluate potential effects of new chemical entities in tissue homeostasis, insight into the physiology of healthy tissue is necessary. Therefore, this review addresses the effects of HDACi on healthy human primary skin cell cultures and three-dimensional epidermal models. In general, HDACi exert an effect on both the epidermal morphology and differentiation process of human skin. The latter is manifested through cell cycle arrest, disorganization of the basal layer, thinning of the stratum spinosum and thickening of the stratum corneum, reorganization of the cytoskeleton and increased formation of cornified envelopes. This overview shows that, although only a limited number of reports exist, these molecules might be an interesting tool for the development and study of new human skin models. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

From the measurement, the TL for rat and porcine skin was found to be 23.5 +/- 2.7 dB and 30.4 +/- 2.8 dB (mean +/- std) at 1 kHz, respectively. Further, the absorption coefficients or the rat and porcine skin were measured as 0.029 +/- 0.011 and 0.031 +/- 0.012 at 1 kHz, respectively. From the measurements, the TL values were found to be significantly increased at the high frequency and the absorption coefficients did not changed significantly in the 1-6 kHz range.

The open-ended coaxial probe technique was used to determine the dielectric properties of tomatoes over a frequency range of 300-3000 MHz for temperatures between 22 and 120 degrees C. Three tomato tissues, the pericarp tissue (including the skin), the locular tissue (including the seeds) and the placental tissue were studied separately. The effects of NaCl (0.2 g/100 g) and CaCl2 (0.055 g/100 g) on the dielectric properties of tomatoes were also investigated. The dielectric loss factors were significantly different among the three tomato tissues. However, no significant differences were found in their corresponding dielectric constants. The loss factors of the three tomato tissues decreased with increasing frequency and increased with salts added. Increasing temperature increased the loss factors of the three tomato tissues at 915 MHz, but initially decreased then increased their corresponding values at 2450 MHz. The differences in the loss factors of the three tomato tissues were mainly caused by the difference in ionic conductivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A 2-week period of baseline monitoring of individually biocalibrated electromyographic (EMG) events associated with sleep bruxism was followed by 6 weeks of EMG-event-contingent treatment via an innocuous electrical pulse to the skin overlying the temporalis muscle. Treatment was discontinued during 2-week follow-up monitoring. Each night before sleep, subjects recorded their average daily pain. Results: Mixed-model analysis of variance showed a reliable reduction of EMG events during contingent stimulation treatment periods, but frequency of EMG events returned to baseline levels during follow-up (linear term, P =.002; quadratic term, P=.001). In contrast, nightly pain reports failed to show any systematic changes during treatment (linear and quadratic trends, both P>.10).

Consequently, the role of Hh in cancer pathology, and its modulation by environmental factors is the subject of many investigations. Numerous environmental toxins, alcohol, and hepatitis viruses can cause hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the most common form of liver cancer. Significant hyperactivation of Hh signaling has been observed in liver injury and cirrhosis which often leads to the development of HCC lesions.

Although extensive efforts in the study of the origin of collagen exceptional mechanical properties, a deep knowledge of the relationship between molecular structure and mechanical properties remains elusive, hindered by the complex hierarchical structure of collagen-based tissues. Understanding the viscoelastic behavior of collagenous tissues requires knowledge of the properties at each structural level. Whole tissues have been studied extensively, but less is known about the mechanical behavior at the submicron, fibrillar and molecular level. Hence, we investigate the viscoelastic properties at the molecular level by using an atomistic modeling approach, performing in silica creep tests of a collagen-like peptide. The results are compared with creep and relaxation tests at the level of isolated collagen fibrils performed previously using a micro-electromechanical systems platform. Individual collagen molecules present a non-linear viscoelastic behavior, with a Young's modulus increasing from 6 to 16 GPa (for strains up to 20%), a viscosity of 3.84 +/- 038 Pa s, and a relaxation time in the range of 0.24-0.64 ns. At the fibrils level, stress-strain-time data indicate that isolated fibrils exhibit viscoelastic behavior that could be fitted using the Maxwell-Weichert model. The fibrils showed an elastic modulus of 123 +/- 46 MPa.

Their morphology is marked by: (i) loss of neurons, foremost in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices resulting in cerebral and cerebellar atrophy; (ii) an almost ubiquitous accumulation of lipopigments in nerve cells, but also in extracerebral tissues. Loss of cortical neurons is selective, indiscriminate depletion in early childhood forms occurring only at an advanced stage, whereas loss of neurons in subcortical grey-matter regions has not been quantitatively documented. Among the fourteen different forms of NCL described to date, CLN1 and CLN10 are marked by granular lipopigments, CLN2 by curvilinear profiles (CVPs), CLN3 by fingerprint profiles (FPPs), and other forms by a combination of these features. Among extracerebral tissues, lymphocytes, skin, rectum, skeletal muscle and, occasionally, conjunctiva are possible guiding targets for diagnostic identification, the precise type of NCL then requiring molecular analysis within the clinical and morphological context. Autosomal-recessive adult NCL has been linked molecularly to different childhood forms, i.e. CLN1, CLN5, and CLN6, whilst autosomal-dominant adult NCL, now designated as CLN4, is caused by a newly identified separate gene, DNAJC5.

        "{'': '', 'AB': 'Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins create structural frameworks in tissues such as bone, skin, tendon and cartilage etc. These connective tissues play important roles in the development and homeostasis of organs. Collagen is the most abundant ECM protein and represents one third of all proteins in humans. The biosynthesis of ECM proteins occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). This review describes the current understanding of the biosynthesis and folding of procollagens, which are the precursor molecules of collagens, in the rER. Multiple folding enzymes and molecular chaperones are required for procollagen to establish specific posttranslational modifications, and facilitate folding and transport to the cell surface. Thus, this molecular ensemble in the rER contributes to ECM maturation and to the development and homeostasis of tissues. Mutations in this ensemble are likely candidates for connective tissue disorders. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Functional and structural diversity of endoplasmic reticulum.

The application of exogenous lactate released from poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymer accelerated angiogenesis and wound healing processes. Curcumin is a well-known topical wound healing agent for both normal and diabetic-impaired wounds. Hence, we hypothesized that the PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin could much potentially accelerate the wound healing. In a full thickness excisional wound healing mouse model, PLGA-curcumin nanoparticles showed a twofold higher wound healing activity compared to that of PLGA or curcumin. Histology and RT-PCR studies confirmed that PLGA-curcumin nanoparticles exhibited higher re-epithelialization, granulation tissue formation and anti-inflammatory potential. PLGA nanoparticles offered various benefits for the encapsulated curcumin like protection from light degradation, enhanced water solubility and showed a sustained release of curcumin over a period of 8 days. In conclusion, we demonstrated the additive effect of lactic acid from PLGA and encapsulated curcumin for the active healing of wounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Eleven Sprague-Dawley rats were studied: 7 rats underwent surface pressure with local heating (Delta t = 10 degrees C) and 4 rats underwent pressure without heating. A pressure of 700 mmHg was applied to the right trochanter area of rats for 3 h. Skin blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. The loading period was divided into nonoverlapping 30 min epochs. For each epoch, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA) was utilized to compute DFA coefficients and complexity of endothelial related metabolic, neurogenic, and myogenic frequencies of BFO. The results showed that under surface pressure, local heating led to a significant decrease in DFA coefficients of myogenic frequency during the initial epoch of loading period, a sustained decrease in complexity of myogenic frequency, and a significantly higher degree of complexity of metabolic frequency during the later phase of loading period. Surrogate tests showed that the reduction in complexity of myogenic frequency was associated with a loss of nonlinearity whereas increased complexity of metabolic frequency was associated with enhanced nonlinearity. Our results indicate that increased metabolic activity and decreased myogenic response due to local heating manifest themselves not only in magnitudes of metabolic and myogenic frequencies but also in their structural complexity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using complexity analysis of BFO to monitor the ischemic status of weight-bearing skin and risk of pressure ulcers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To study the cooperating leukemogenesis by MLL/AF10 and KRAS mutation, we retrovirally transduced MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C) into mouse bone marrow cells and generated two immortalized cell lines. The cells carrying cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C) had immature myelomonocytic phenotypes. Compared to a previously established cell line carrying MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) alone, cooperation of MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) with KRAS(G12C) blocked the cells at a more immature myelomonocytic stage with reduced expression of monocyte/macrophage markers. The mice transplanted with the cells carrying cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C), liked those transplanted with the cells carrying MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) alone, induced myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid leukemia, but in a shorter latency and formed multiple MS at the adipose tissues of skin, peritoneum and intraperitoneal cavity. Cooperation of MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) with KRAS(G12C) increased cell adhesion via upregulation of an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr125. Knockdown of Gpr125 in the cells by short hairpin RNA reduced cell aggregation and diminished MS formation in the transplanted mice. Our results indicated that upregulation of Gpr125 by cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C) promoted cell adhesion and contributed to the MS formation. What's new?

YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that controls cellular responses through interaction with TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus, while its transcriptional functions are inhibited by phosphorylation-dependent translocation to the cytosol. YAP overexpression has been associated with different types of cancer, such as lung, skin, prostate, ovary and liver cancer. Recently, YAP was linked to E-cadherin-dependent regulation of contact inhibition in breast cancer cells. In this study we examined YAP protein expression and cellular localization in 237 cases of human invasive breast cancer by immunohistochemistry and related its expression to clinicopathological features and E-cadherin expression. We observed that invasive lobular carcinoma is characterized by higher expression levels of both nuclear and cytosolic YAP (p < 0.001). Nuclear YAP expression did not associate with other variables such as lymph node involvement, tumor grade, tumor size, mitotic activity or the molecular sub-types of invasive breast cancer. We observed that high nuclear and cytosolic YAP expression are associated with the E-cadherin deficient breast cancer subtype ILC (p < 0.001) and cell lines derived from human breast cancers and conditional mouse models of human lobular breast cancer. Since our data indicate that nuclear YAP localization is more common in breast cancers lacking functional adherens junctions, it suggests that YAP-mediated transcription may be involved in the development and progression of invasive lobular breast cancer.', 'DI': '10.1007/s13402-013-0143-7', 'IS': '5', 'VL': '36', 'ZB': '0', 'AU': ['Vlug, Eva J.', 'van de Ven, Robert A.

The cell adhesion and growth were then evaluated directly on the materials, and also on the underlying polystyrene culture dishes. Of these two types of studied materials, 6-carboxycellulose with 2.1 wt% of -COOH groups was more appropriate for cell colonization. The cells on this material achieved an elongated shape, while they were spherical in shape on the other materials. The number of cells and the concentration (per mg of protein) of contractile proteins alpha-actin and SM1 and SM2 myosins, i.e. markers of the phenotypic maturation of VSMC, were also significantly higher on this material. Functionalization of the material with arginine and chitosan further improved the phenotypic maturation of VSMC. Chitosan also improved the adhesion and growth of these cells. In comparison with the control polystyrene dishes, the proliferation of cells on our cellulose-based materials was relatively low.

This review analyses key aspects of that progression of models, against a background of what exactly each model system tries to mimic. This story tracks our increasing understanding of fibroblast responses to soft collagen gels, in particularly their cytoskeletal contraction, migration and integrin attachment. The focus on fibroblast mechano-function has generated models designed to directly measure the overall force generated by fibroblast populations, their reaction to external loads and the role of the matrix structure. Key steps along this evolution of 3D collagen models have been designed to mimic normal skin, wound repair, tissue morphogenesis and remodelling, growth and contracture during scarring/fibrosis. As new models are developed to understand cell-mechanical function in connective tissues the collagen material has become progressively more important, now being engineered to mimic more complex aspects of native extracellular matrix structure. These have included collagen fibril density, alignment and hierarchical structure, controlling material stiffness and anisotropy. But of these, tissue-like collagen density is key in that it contributes to control of the others. It is concluded that across this 40 year window major progress has been made towards establishing a family of 3D experimental collagen tissue-models, suitable to investigate normal and pathological fibroblast mechano-functions.

The aim of this work was to develop and validate a new chromatographic method to analyze linezolid in plasma and in dried plasma spots and to evaluate the correlation between the two extraction methods. Linezolid extraction from plasma and from dried plasma spots was obtained using acetonitrile. Quinoxaline was used as internal standard. Analysis was performed by an ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system coupled with photo diode array (PDA) detector, at 254 nm. Both analytical methods were linear (r(2)>0.999) over the calibration range of 30-0.117 mg/L. Limit of quantification and limit of detection were 0.117 mg/L and 0.058 mg/L, respectively. Intra and inter-day precision (R.S.D.%) and accuracy (%) were <15%. Long term stability of linezolid in dried plasma spots showed absence of degradation at room temperature (20-25 degrees C) and at 4 degrees C, for at least one month.

Wild-type and AKO mice were grown to 7 weeks (young) or 37 weeks (old) of age on a regular chow or high-fat diet (HFD), given a 1-cm diameter full thickness wound on their mid dorsum and allowed to heal for 16 days. Old AKO mice fed a HFD exhibited reduced wound closure, delayed contraction, chronic inflammation and altered ECM remodeling. Conversely, GzmB/ApoE double knockout mice displayed improved wound closure and contraction rates. In addition, murine GzmB was found to degrade both fibronectin and vitronectin derived from healthy mouse granulation tissue. In addition, GzmB-mediated degradation of fibronectin generated a fragment similar in size to that observed in non-healing mouse wounds. These results provide the first direct evidence that GzmB contributes to chronic wound healing in part through degradation of ECM.', 'DI': '10.1038/cdd.2013.96', 'IS': '10', 'VL': '20', 'ZB': '0', 'AU': ['Hiebert, P.

        "{'': '', 'AB': 'Hydroquinone and tranexamic acids (TXA) are skin-lightening agents with a hydrophilic nature and low skin absorption. A high dose is needed for clinical use, resulting in a high incidence of skin irritation. Co-drugs formed by conjugating hydroquinone and TXA were synthesized and their in vitro and in vivo skin absorption characteristics were evaluated. The two synthesized co-drugs were 4-hydroxyphenyl 4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylate (HAC) and 1,4-phenylene bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylate (BAC). The co-drugs were chemically stable in aqueous solution, but rapidly degraded to the respective parent drug in esterases and skin homogenates. Compared to hydroquinone application, 7.2- and 2.4-fold increments in the hydroquinone skin deposition were obtained with the in vitro application of HAC and BAC. HAC and BAC led to 3- and 2-fold enhancements of equivalent TXA deposition compared to TXA administration. The in vivo experiment showed a further enhancement of co-drugs compared to the in vitro setup. The transdermal penetration of co-drugs, especially BAC, was much lower than that of hydroquinone and TXA. This indicated high-level skin targeting by the co-drugs. HAC and BAC revealed strong affinities for the viable epidermis/dermis. Hair follicles are important reservoirs for co-drug delivery.

Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daptomycin in elderly patients. Study design This was an open-label, multicentre, randomized phase IIIb study conducted in hospitalized patients Patients aged >= 65 years with a diagnosis of Gram-positive cSSTIs with or without bacteraemia were included. In addition, infections were required to be of sufficient severity to require inpatient hospitalization and treatment with parenteral antibiotics for at least 96 h. The main exclusion criterion was the presence of a non-complicated SSTI that could heal by itself or be cured by surgical removal of the site of infection. Intervention Patients were randomized (2:1) to intravenous daptomycin or pooled intravenous standard therapies (semi-synthetic penicillin or vancomycin, referred to as the 'comparator'). Duration of treatment was between 5 and 14 days for cSSTIs without bacteraemia and between 10 and 28 days for cSSTIs with bacteraemia. Main Outcome Measure The primary objective was descriptive comparison of clinical success in clinically evaluable patients at test of cure, 7-14 days post treatment. Secondary objectives were microbiological outcome, duration of treatment and safety. Results In total, 120 patients were randomized (81 to daptomycin; 39 to the comparator) and 102 patients completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Common infections included cellulitis, ulcers and abscesses; six patients had bacteraemia [five documented (daptomycin, n = 3; comparator, n = 2); and one suspected (daptomycin, n = 1)]. Test-of-cure clinical success rates were numerically higher for daptomycin than for the comparator [89.0 % (65/73) vs. 83.3 % (25/30); odds ratio 1.65 (95 % confidence interval 0.49-5.54)]. For patients with S. aureus infections, cure rates were 89.7 % (35/39) versus 69.2 % (9/13), respectively; percentage points difference, 20.5 (95 % confidence interval -12.2 to 50.9)]. Rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar in both treatment arms; however, discontinuation rates for AEs/serious AEs were lower for daptomycin than for the comparator (3.8 % vs. 10.0 %). Three serious AEs were considered to be related to the study drug: one case each of pancytopenia (semi-synthetic penicillin), renal failure (vancomycin) and asymptomatic increase in creatine phosphokinase concentrations (daptomycin). Conclusion In elderly patients, for whom data were previously limited, the efficacy and safety of daptomycin have been confirmed, including for infections caused by S. aureus, regardless of methicillin susceptibility.\", 'DI': '10.1007/s40266-013-0114-8', 'IS': '10', 'VL': '30', 'ZB': '0', 'AU': ['Konychev, Alexander', 'Heep, Markus', 'Moritz, Rose K.

        "{'': '', 'AB': \"Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) may occur in children with cancer during the use of almost all chemotherapeutic drugs. HSRs may also produce a negative impact on treatment intensity and, as a consequence, worsen patients' outcome. The aim of this review is to summarize the incidence and the clinical features of HSRs occurring in children with cancer treated with chemotherapeutic drugs and their impact on treatment efficacy, in order to outline possible adequate prevention and management strategies. Data were collected by searching for relevant studies about incidence, clinical features and management of hypersensitivity reactions that may occur with the use of chemotherapeutic agents in children aged 0-18 years, published from January 1976 to December 2012 in the PubMed database. In children with cancer treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (especially platinum compounds, methotrexate, L-asparaginase), HSRs commonly present with mild/moderate to severe clinical patterns. Multiple factors appear to affect reaction rates, including route, rate of administration, previous exposure, drug form, presence of excipients. The occurrence of hypersensitivity to a chemotherapeutic agent can include the avoidance of re-exposure. For sensitized patients who have derived clinically meaningful benefit from a particular agent, however, continuation of treatment with the agent is desirable. Options may include attempting a trial of desensitization or treatment with a related compound. With the increasing use of cancer chemotherapy agents, hypersensitivity reactions to antineoplastic drugs are commonly encountered. Clinicians must not underestimate the potential risk and occurrence of HSRs in the pediatric population. Knowledge of the different presentations of these reactions can help to develop strategies for the prevention and the management of HSRs in order to ensure treatment outcome, to improve the quality of patient care and to reduce healthcare costs.\", 'DI': '10.1007/s00228-013-1546-0', 'IS': '10', 'EF': '', 'VL': '69', 'ZB': '0', 'AU': ['Ruggiero, Antonio', 'Triarico, Silvia', 'Trombatore, Giovanna', 'Battista, Andrea', \"Dell'Acqua, Fabiola\", 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Riccardi, Riccardo'], 'CR': None, 'EP': '1746', 'ZS': '0', 'Z8': '0', 'PT': 'J', 'UT': 'WOS:000324333800001', 'PY': 2013, 'SO': 'EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY', 'Z9': '0', 'PD': 'OCT 2013', 'TI': 'Incidence, clinical features and management of hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapeutic drugs in children with cancer', 'BP': '1739', 'C1': None, 'ER': '', 'TC': '0', 'SN': '0031-6970'} \n",

Only little is known with respect to their effects on normal cells. Yet, to understand tissue pathology and evaluate potential effects of new chemical entities in tissue homeostasis, insight into the physiology of healthy tissue is necessary. Therefore, this review addresses the effects of HDACi on healthy human primary skin cell cultures and three-dimensional epidermal models. In general, HDACi exert an effect on both the epidermal morphology and differentiation process of human skin. The latter is manifested through cell cycle arrest, disorganization of the basal layer, thinning of the stratum spinosum and thickening of the stratum corneum, reorganization of the cytoskeleton and increased formation of cornified envelopes. This overview shows that, although only a limited number of reports exist, these molecules might be an interesting tool for the development and study of new human skin models. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

Three tomato tissues, the pericarp tissue (including the skin), the locular tissue (including the seeds) and the placental tissue were studied separately. The effects of NaCl (0.2 g/100 g) and CaCl2 (0.055 g/100 g) on the dielectric properties of tomatoes were also investigated. The dielectric loss factors were significantly different among the three tomato tissues. However, no significant differences were found in their corresponding dielectric constants. The loss factors of the three tomato tissues decreased with increasing frequency and increased with salts added. Increasing temperature increased the loss factors of the three tomato tissues at 915 MHz, but initially decreased then increased their corresponding values at 2450 MHz. The differences in the loss factors of the three tomato tissues were mainly caused by the difference in ionic conductivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although extensive efforts in the study of the origin of collagen exceptional mechanical properties, a deep knowledge of the relationship between molecular structure and mechanical properties remains elusive, hindered by the complex hierarchical structure of collagen-based tissues. Understanding the viscoelastic behavior of collagenous tissues requires knowledge of the properties at each structural level. Whole tissues have been studied extensively, but less is known about the mechanical behavior at the submicron, fibrillar and molecular level. Hence, we investigate the viscoelastic properties at the molecular level by using an atomistic modeling approach, performing in silica creep tests of a collagen-like peptide. The results are compared with creep and relaxation tests at the level of isolated collagen fibrils performed previously using a micro-electromechanical systems platform. Individual collagen molecules present a non-linear viscoelastic behavior, with a Young's modulus increasing from 6 to 16 GPa (for strains up to 20%), a viscosity of 3.84 +/- 038 Pa s, and a relaxation time in the range of 0.24-0.64 ns. At the fibrils level, stress-strain-time data indicate that isolated fibrils exhibit viscoelastic behavior that could be fitted using the Maxwell-Weichert model. The fibrils showed an elastic modulus of 123 +/- 46 MPa.

Their morphology is marked by: (i) loss of neurons, foremost in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices resulting in cerebral and cerebellar atrophy; (ii) an almost ubiquitous accumulation of lipopigments in nerve cells, but also in extracerebral tissues. Loss of cortical neurons is selective, indiscriminate depletion in early childhood forms occurring only at an advanced stage, whereas loss of neurons in subcortical grey-matter regions has not been quantitatively documented. Among the fourteen different forms of NCL described to date, CLN1 and CLN10 are marked by granular lipopigments, CLN2 by curvilinear profiles (CVPs), CLN3 by fingerprint profiles (FPPs), and other forms by a combination of these features. Among extracerebral tissues, lymphocytes, skin, rectum, skeletal muscle and, occasionally, conjunctiva are possible guiding targets for diagnostic identification, the precise type of NCL then requiring molecular analysis within the clinical and morphological context.

Collagen is the most abundant ECM protein and represents one third of all proteins in humans. The biosynthesis of ECM proteins occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). This review describes the current understanding of the biosynthesis and folding of procollagens, which are the precursor molecules of collagens, in the rER. Multiple folding enzymes and molecular chaperones are required for procollagen to establish specific posttranslational modifications, and facilitate folding and transport to the cell surface. Thus, this molecular ensemble in the rER contributes to ECM maturation and to the development and homeostasis of tissues. Mutations in this ensemble are likely candidates for connective tissue disorders. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Functional and structural diversity of endoplasmic reticulum.

The application of exogenous lactate released from poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymer accelerated angiogenesis and wound healing processes. Curcumin is a well-known topical wound healing agent for both normal and diabetic-impaired wounds. Hence, we hypothesized that the PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin could much potentially accelerate the wound healing. In a full thickness excisional wound healing mouse model, PLGA-curcumin nanoparticles showed a twofold higher wound healing activity compared to that of PLGA or curcumin. Histology and RT-PCR studies confirmed that PLGA-curcumin nanoparticles exhibited higher re-epithelialization, granulation tissue formation and anti-inflammatory potential. PLGA nanoparticles offered various benefits for the encapsulated curcumin like protection from light degradation, enhanced water solubility and showed a sustained release of curcumin over a period of 8 days. In conclusion, we demonstrated the additive effect of lactic acid from PLGA and encapsulated curcumin for the active healing of wounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Eleven Sprague-Dawley rats were studied: 7 rats underwent surface pressure with local heating (Delta t = 10 degrees C) and 4 rats underwent pressure without heating. A pressure of 700 mmHg was applied to the right trochanter area of rats for 3 h. Skin blood flow was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry. The loading period was divided into nonoverlapping 30 min epochs. For each epoch, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA) was utilized to compute DFA coefficients and complexity of endothelial related metabolic, neurogenic, and myogenic frequencies of BFO. The results showed that under surface pressure, local heating led to a significant decrease in DFA coefficients of myogenic frequency during the initial epoch of loading period, a sustained decrease in complexity of myogenic frequency, and a significantly higher degree of complexity of metabolic frequency during the later phase of loading period. Surrogate tests showed that the reduction in complexity of myogenic frequency was associated with a loss of nonlinearity whereas increased complexity of metabolic frequency was associated with enhanced nonlinearity. Our results indicate that increased metabolic activity and decreased myogenic response due to local heating manifest themselves not only in magnitudes of metabolic and myogenic frequencies but also in their structural complexity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using complexity analysis of BFO to monitor the ischemic status of weight-bearing skin and risk of pressure ulcers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To study the cooperating leukemogenesis by MLL/AF10 and KRAS mutation, we retrovirally transduced MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C) into mouse bone marrow cells and generated two immortalized cell lines. The cells carrying cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C) had immature myelomonocytic phenotypes. Compared to a previously established cell line carrying MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) alone, cooperation of MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) with KRAS(G12C) blocked the cells at a more immature myelomonocytic stage with reduced expression of monocyte/macrophage markers. The mice transplanted with the cells carrying cooperating MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) and KRAS(G12C), liked those transplanted with the cells carrying MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) alone, induced myeloproliferative disease-like myeloid leukemia, but in a shorter latency and formed multiple MS at the adipose tissues of skin, peritoneum and intraperitoneal cavity. Cooperation of MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) with KRAS(G12C) increased cell adhesion via upregulation of an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr125. Knockdown of Gpr125 in the cells by short hairpin RNA reduced cell aggregation and diminished MS formation in the transplanted mice.

YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that controls cellular responses through interaction with TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus, while its transcriptional functions are inhibited by phosphorylation-dependent translocation to the cytosol. YAP overexpression has been associated with different types of cancer, such as lung, skin, prostate, ovary and liver cancer. Recently, YAP was linked to E-cadherin-dependent regulation of contact inhibition in breast cancer cells. In this study we examined YAP protein expression and cellular localization in 237 cases of human invasive breast cancer by immunohistochemistry and related its expression to clinicopathological features and E-cadherin expression. We observed that invasive lobular carcinoma is characterized by higher expression levels of both nuclear and cytosolic YAP (p < 0.001). Nuclear YAP expression did not associate with other variables such as lymph node involvement, tumor grade, tumor size, mitotic activity or the molecular sub-types of invasive breast cancer. We observed that high nuclear and cytosolic YAP expression are associated with the E-cadherin deficient breast cancer subtype ILC (p < 0.001) and cell lines derived from human breast cancers and conditional mouse models of human lobular breast cancer. Since our data indicate that nuclear YAP localization is more common in breast cancers lacking functional adherens junctions, it suggests that YAP-mediated transcription may be involved in the development and progression of invasive lobular breast cancer.', 'DI': '10.1007/s13402-013-0143-7', 'IS': '5', 'VL': '36', 'ZB': '0', 'AU': ['Vlug, Eva J.', 'van de Ven, Robert A.

The cell adhesion and growth were then evaluated directly on the materials, and also on the underlying polystyrene culture dishes. Of these two types of studied materials, 6-carboxycellulose with 2.1 wt% of -COOH groups was more appropriate for cell colonization. The cells on this material achieved an elongated shape, while they were spherical in shape on the other materials. The number of cells and the concentration (per mg of protein) of contractile proteins alpha-actin and SM1 and SM2 myosins, i.e. markers of the phenotypic maturation of VSMC, were also significantly higher on this material. Functionalization of the material with arginine and chitosan further improved the phenotypic maturation of VSMC. Chitosan also improved the adhesion and growth of these cells. In comparison with the control polystyrene dishes, the proliferation of cells on our cellulose-based materials was relatively low.

This review analyses key aspects of that progression of models, against a background of what exactly each model system tries to mimic. This story tracks our increasing understanding of fibroblast responses to soft collagen gels, in particularly their cytoskeletal contraction, migration and integrin attachment. The focus on fibroblast mechano-function has generated models designed to directly measure the overall force generated by fibroblast populations, their reaction to external loads and the role of the matrix structure. Key steps along this evolution of 3D collagen models have been designed to mimic normal skin, wound repair, tissue morphogenesis and remodelling, growth and contracture during scarring/fibrosis. As new models are developed to understand cell-mechanical function in connective tissues the collagen material has become progressively more important, now being engineered to mimic more complex aspects of native extracellular matrix structure. These have included collagen fibril density, alignment and hierarchical structure, controlling material stiffness and anisotropy. But of these, tissue-like collagen density is key in that it contributes to control of the others. It is concluded that across this 40 year window major progress has been made towards establishing a family of 3D experimental collagen tissue-models, suitable to investigate normal and pathological fibroblast mechano-functions.

To overcome these problems, the use of dried plasma spots or dried blood spots is increasing. The aim of this work was to develop and validate a new chromatographic method to analyze linezolid in plasma and in dried plasma spots and to evaluate the correlation between the two extraction methods. Linezolid extraction from plasma and from dried plasma spots was obtained using acetonitrile. Quinoxaline was used as internal standard. Analysis was performed by an ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system coupled with photo diode array (PDA) detector, at 254 nm. Both analytical methods were linear (r(2)>0.999) over the calibration range of 30-0.117 mg/L. Limit of quantification and limit of detection were 0.117 mg/L and 0.058 mg/L, respectively. Intra and inter-day precision (R.S.D.%) and accuracy (%) were <15%. Long term stability of linezolid in dried plasma spots showed absence of degradation at room temperature (20-25 degrees C) and at 4 degrees C, for at least one month. Linear regression analysis confirmed that the two methods of extraction have good correlation. Thus they are suited for TDM of linezolid and for pharmacokinetic studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Granzyme B (GzmB) is a serine protease expressed during chronic inflammation that, in conjunction with perforin, has a well-established role in initiating apoptotic cell death. GzmB is also capable of acting extracellularly, independent of perforin and can degrade several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that are critical during wound healing. We used apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout (AKO) mice as a novel model of chronic inflammation and impaired wound healing to investigate the role of GzmB in chronic wounds. Wild-type and AKO mice were grown to 7 weeks (young) or 37 weeks (old) of age on a regular chow or high-fat diet (HFD), given a 1-cm diameter full thickness wound on their mid dorsum and allowed to heal for 16 days. Old AKO mice fed a HFD exhibited reduced wound closure, delayed contraction, chronic inflammation and altered ECM remodeling. Conversely, GzmB/ApoE double knockout mice displayed improved wound closure and contraction rates. In addition, murine GzmB was found to degrade both fibronectin and vitronectin derived from healthy mouse granulation tissue. In addition, GzmB-mediated degradation of fibronectin generated a fragment similar in size to that observed in non-healing mouse wounds.

The two synthesized co-drugs were 4-hydroxyphenyl 4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylate (HAC) and 1,4-phenylene bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylate (BAC). The co-drugs were chemically stable in aqueous solution, but rapidly degraded to the respective parent drug in esterases and skin homogenates. Compared to hydroquinone application, 7.2- and 2.4-fold increments in the hydroquinone skin deposition were obtained with the in vitro application of HAC and BAC. HAC and BAC led to 3- and 2-fold enhancements of equivalent TXA deposition compared to TXA administration. The in vivo experiment showed a further enhancement of co-drugs compared to the in vitro setup. The transdermal penetration of co-drugs, especially BAC, was much lower than that of hydroquinone and TXA. This indicated high-level skin targeting by the co-drugs.

Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daptomycin in elderly patients. Study design This was an open-label, multicentre, randomized phase IIIb study conducted in hospitalized patients Patients aged >= 65 years with a diagnosis of Gram-positive cSSTIs with or without bacteraemia were included. In addition, infections were required to be of sufficient severity to require inpatient hospitalization and treatment with parenteral antibiotics for at least 96 h. The main exclusion criterion was the presence of a non-complicated SSTI that could heal by itself or be cured by surgical removal of the site of infection. Intervention Patients were randomized (2:1) to intravenous daptomycin or pooled intravenous standard therapies (semi-synthetic penicillin or vancomycin, referred to as the 'comparator'). Duration of treatment was between 5 and 14 days for cSSTIs without bacteraemia and between 10 and 28 days for cSSTIs with bacteraemia. Main Outcome Measure The primary objective was descriptive comparison of clinical success in clinically evaluable patients at test of cure, 7-14 days post treatment. Secondary objectives were microbiological outcome, duration of treatment and safety. Results In total, 120 patients were randomized (81 to daptomycin; 39 to the comparator) and 102 patients completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Common infections included cellulitis, ulcers and abscesses; six patients had bacteraemia [five documented (daptomycin, n = 3; comparator, n = 2); and one suspected (daptomycin, n = 1)]. Test-of-cure clinical success rates were numerically higher for daptomycin than for the comparator [89.0 % (65/73) vs. 83.3 % (25/30); odds ratio 1.65 (95 % confidence interval 0.49-5.54)]. For patients with S. aureus infections, cure rates were 89.7 % (35/39) versus 69.2 % (9/13), respectively; percentage points difference, 20.5 (95 % confidence interval -12.2 to 50.9)]. Rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar in both treatment arms; however, discontinuation rates for AEs/serious AEs were lower for daptomycin than for the comparator (3.8 % vs. 10.0 %). Three serious AEs were considered to be related to the study drug: one case each of pancytopenia (semi-synthetic penicillin), renal failure (vancomycin) and asymptomatic increase in creatine phosphokinase concentrations (daptomycin). Conclusion In elderly patients, for whom data were previously limited, the efficacy and safety of daptomycin have been confirmed, including for infections caused by S. aureus, regardless of methicillin susceptibility.\", 'DI': '10.1007/s40266-013-0114-8', 'IS': '10', 'VL': '30', 'ZB': '0', 'AU': ['Konychev, Alexander', 'Heep, Markus', 'Moritz, Rose K.

HSRs may also produce a negative impact on treatment intensity and, as a consequence, worsen patients' outcome. The aim of this review is to summarize the incidence and the clinical features of HSRs occurring in children with cancer treated with chemotherapeutic drugs and their impact on treatment efficacy, in order to outline possible adequate prevention and management strategies. Data were collected by searching for relevant studies about incidence, clinical features and management of hypersensitivity reactions that may occur with the use of chemotherapeutic agents in children aged 0-18 years, published from January 1976 to December 2012 in the PubMed database. In children with cancer treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (especially platinum compounds, methotrexate, L-asparaginase), HSRs commonly present with mild/moderate to severe clinical patterns. Multiple factors appear to affect reaction rates, including route, rate of administration, previous exposure, drug form, presence of excipients. The occurrence of hypersensitivity to a chemotherapeutic agent can include the avoidance of re-exposure. For sensitized patients who have derived clinically meaningful benefit from a particular agent, however, continuation of treatment with the agent is desirable. Options may include attempting a trial of desensitization or treatment with a related compound. With the increasing use of cancer chemotherapy agents, hypersensitivity reactions to antineoplastic drugs are commonly encountered. Clinicians must not underestimate the potential risk and occurrence of HSRs in the pediatric population. Knowledge of the different presentations of these reactions can help to develop strategies for the prevention and the management of HSRs in order to ensure treatment outcome, to improve the quality of patient care and to reduce healthcare costs.\", 'DI': '10.1007/s00228-013-1546-0', 'IS': '10', 'EF': '', 'VL': '69', 'ZB': '0', 'AU': ['Ruggiero, Antonio', 'Triarico, Silvia', 'Trombatore, Giovanna', 'Battista, Andrea', \"Dell'Acqua, Fabiola\", 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Riccardi, Riccardo'], 'CR': None, 'EP': '1746', 'ZS': '0', 'Z8': '0', 'PT': 'J', 'UT': 'WOS:000324333800001', 'PY': 2013, 'SO': 'EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY', 'Z9': '0', 'PD': 'OCT 2013', 'TI': 'Incidence, clinical features and management of hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapeutic drugs in children with cancer', 'BP': '1739', 'C1': None, 'ER': '', 'TC': '0', 'SN': '0031-6970'} \n",
