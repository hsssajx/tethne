# Tethne

Tethne is a script for analyzing bibliographic data. The primary emphasis is on parsing
and analyzing citation data from the Web of Science. Future versions will support data
from PubMed, Scopus, and other scholarly databases. Tethne can be used to generate and
analyze a variety of networks, such as bibliographic coupling, citation, author-paper, 
and co-author networks, using [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/).

For more information, see the Tethne [website](https://github.com/diging/tethne) and
(documentation)[http://diging.github.io/tethne/api/] (under development).
